# Omnifood Website Project

This project was created as part of a course I completed on **HTML & CSS**, where I learned a wide range of skills related to web development. The course culminated in building a fully responsive website for **Omnifood**, a fictional service that promotes healthy eating by delivering personalized meals at the time of your choice.

The key goal of the Omnifood project is to highlight the importance of eating proper, nutritious food, while showcasing the functionality of an online food delivery service. The project allowed me to apply key concepts such as responsive design, modern layout techniques, and CSS best practices.

### Instructor
The course was taught by **Jonas Schmedtmann**, a well-known Web Developer and Designer. You can check out his Udemy profile [here](https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/) for more information.
